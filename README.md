# Machine Learning Notebook Collection

In this mini-project collection includes three different Jupyter notebooks with basic machine learning, data visualization, and logic building/modelingmodels. Each one is built with ease simple mind, making them easy to read or showing concepts.


## 1. Loan Approval Prediction (Loan_approval.ipynb + loan.csv)
This notebook derives basic machine learning to predict whether a loan should be approved based on user data. It uses classification models (likely Logistic Regression or Decision Tree), processes real or sample input scores, and outputs a binary result — approved(1) or not approved(0). example of ML applied in finance seletion.


## 2. Weather Game Logic Model (weatherGame_ML.ipynb + weather.csv)
This one is a fun ML logic model where the notebook takes weather conditions as inputs (like "Sunny", "Rainy" and +2 ) and predicts to play game or not . It tells more about how ML can work on label as classifiers. Demo that's useful for learning classification.


## 3. Graphs and Plotting (graphs.ipynb)
This notebook demonstrates graph creation using random data and plotting with Matplotlib. It covers procedural generation of values, midpoint highlights, labeled points, and line plotting. It’s a clean example of how to visualize data dynamically using NumPy and Matplotlib in Python. great example- use in game industry or entertainment to quickly generate high quality content using code like minecraft world everthing is procedurally render using a blueprint known as Seed of world  crazy :)
