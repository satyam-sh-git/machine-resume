# Machine Learning Notebook Collection

In this mini-project collection includes three different Jupyter notebooks with basic machine learning, data visualization, and logic building/modelingmodels. Each one is built with ease simple mind, making them easy to read or showing concepts.


## 1. Loan Approval Prediction (Loan_approval.ipynb + loan.csv)
This notebook derives basic machine learning to predict whether a loan should be approved based on user data. It uses classification models (likely Logistic Regression or Decision Tree), processes real or sample input scores, and outputs a binary result — approved(1) or not approved(0). example of ML applied in finance seletion.


## 2. Weather Game Logic Model (weatherGame_ML.ipynb + weather.csv)
This one is a fun ML logic model where the notebook takes weather conditions as inputs (like "Sunny", "Rainy" and +2 ) and predicts to play game or not . It tells more about how ML can work on label as classifiers. Demo that's useful for learning classification.


## 3. Graphs and Plotting (graphs.ipynb)
This notebook demonstrates graph creation using random data and plotting with Matplotlib. It covers procedural generation of values, midpoint highlights, labeled points, and line plotting. It’s a clean example of how to visualize data dynamically using NumPy and Matplotlib in Python. great example- use in game industry or entertainment to quickly generate high quality content using code like minecraft world everthing is procedurally render using a blueprint known as Seed of world  crazy :)

### 4. Recommendation system from 5000 movie (movie_recommendation.ipynb + [Movie Dataset used](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata))
In this project, I built a **Tag-Based Movie Recommendation System**.  
Each movie is represented using combined tags (from genres, cast, crew and overview). **simple and earlier approach**

I used **NLP techniques** like stemming and vectorization to process the tags.  
Then, I calculated **cosine similarity** to find and recommend the top 5 closest movies based on content.  
This allows the system to suggest similar movies effectively without using user ratings or behavior.

2 libraries you may install like **nltk and ast** rest of them you might already have
